A typical TensorFlow program constructs a computational graph first, then creates a session to execute the operations in the graph. Let's create a very simple graph and run it in a session to compute the geometric mean of two numbers. In this example we used placeholders to feed the inputs to the graph. By defining a placeholder we tell the model that we will feed the values later, when we execute the graph. Feeding data this was can lead to input/output bottlenecks in large scale applications. We will later see how to read data in parallel while the graph is being executed."
